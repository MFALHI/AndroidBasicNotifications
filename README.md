Basic android sample app to learn how to display app notifications.

Tap the button to send a notification. The notification\'s icon will immediately appear in the notification bar. 

Drag the notification bar open to see the full notification. Depending on which version of Android you\'re running, the full
notification will display an icon and two or three lines of text.
